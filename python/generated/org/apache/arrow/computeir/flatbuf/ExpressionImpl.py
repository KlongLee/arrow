# An expression is one of
# - a Literal datum
# - a reference to a field from a Relation
# - a call to a named function
# - a case expression
# - a cast expression
# - an extract operation
# - a window function call
# - an aggregate function call
#
# The expressions here that look like function calls such as
# Cast,Case and Extract are special in that while they might
# fit into a Call, they don't cleanly do so without having
# to pass around non-expression arguments as metadata.
#
# AggregateCall and WindowCall are also separate variants
# due to special options for each that don't apply to generic
# function calls. Again this is done to make it easier
# for consumers to deal with the structure of the operation
