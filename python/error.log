  By not providing "Findlz4.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "lz4", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "lz4" with any of
  the following names:

    lz4Config.cmake
    lz4-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "lz4" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "lz4_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "lz4" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
