# Example Flight Client

This client can connect to a server, and will:

 1. Attempt to upload a test Arrow table
 2. Query metadata about available flights and the uploaded Arrow table
 3. Download the test Arrow table.

To test this, you will want to run the Example Flight Server and then run this.
