# Example Flight Client

This client can connect to a server, and will:

 1. Upload a test Arrow table
 2. Query metadata about available flights and the uploaded Arrow table
 3. Download the test Arrow table.
 4. Clear data on the server.

To test this, start the Example Flight Server first and then run this.
