**About the team**

The team is full of experts, software engineers and core developers
but also full of users, learners and enthusiasts that love doing what we
do and we want to spread this enthusiasm to you also.

We all have silly questions and we all need help lots of times.
We encourage you to be open to communication and we will help as much as
we can.

Where to get help ðŸ‘‹
====================

Jira
~~~~~~~~

Thhe most used way is to communicate through Jira.
When to use this option?

- **Want to solve a bug** â†’ post an issue on Jira and connect with the team
  in the comments.
- **Want to solve an issue that is already in Jira** â†’ connect with the team
  in the comments.

Jira is used to discuss the problem before the PR is made (how to start,
where to search for the solution, etc..).

.. note::
   How to make a Jira ticket. See `Tips for using JIRA <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html#tips-for-using-jira/>`_.

Github
~~~~~~

- Github is used to discuss the **content of the PR**.
- **You have a problem with the build** â†’ you can make an issue on GitHub
  and discuss the possible solution (or write to the user mailing list).

  It is scary to make an issue for something that you have no clue about.
  But no problem, we all have to go through that!

  .. warning::
     Make sure to add the version of the operating system and the software
     you are using in the ticket description plus the debug information/error.

User and dev mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subscribe to the user or development mailing list and browse for
previous topics or ask a question. There is also a biweekly developers sync
call that anyone is welcome to join. It is held every second Wednesday at
12:00 noon Eastern time. Link to the meeting is sent to the dev mailing list.
