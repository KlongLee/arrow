New Contributors Guide
**********************

Starting to contribute to a project like Apache Arrow can look
scary if not completely impossible. But I can reassure you it is
not. What we have to do is to take small steps and after the work
is done the situation will look completely different as to when
we started.

Why contribute to Arrow?
========================
There can be various reasons why someone would want to contribute
and all of them are great!

* You find the project interesting and would like to give it a go,
  learn and grow.

* You use Arrow in the project you are working on and it would be
  super cool to make some quick fixes by yourself.

About the project

About the team
==============

The team is full of experts, top level software engineers and developers
but also full of users, learners and enthusiasts that love doing what we
do and we want to spread this enthusiasm to you also.

We all have silly questions and we all need help lots of times.
We encourage you to be open to communication and we will help as much as
we can.

Reaching out to the team ðŸ‘‹
===========================

There are few possibilities of reaching out to the team. Letâ€™s see which.

**Jira**

The easiest and the most used way is to communicate through Jira.

When to use this option?

- Want to solve a bug â†’ post an issue on Jira and connect with the team
  in the comments.
- Want to solve an issue that is already in Jira â†’ connect with the team
  in the comments.
- You have a problem with the build â†’ you can also make a ticket in Jira
  for it and discuss the possible solution.

  It is scary to make an issue for something that you have no clue about.
  But no problem, we are here to help!

  .. warning::
     Make sure to add the version of the operating system and the software
     you are using in the ticket description plus the debug information/error.

.. note::
   How to make a Jira ticket. See `Tips for using JIRA <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/contributing.html#tips-for-using-jira/>`_.

**Github**

Github is used to discuss the content of the PR.

Jira is used to discuss the problem before the PR is made (how to start,
where to search for the solution, etc..).

**User and dev mailing list**

You can subscribe to the user or development mailing list and browse for
previous topics or ask a question. There is also a biweekly developers sync
call that anyone is welcome to join. It is held every second Wednesday at
12:00 noon Eastern time. Link to the meeting is sent to the dev mailing list.

.. note::

What awaits you?
================

There are three major parts in the process of contributing to Arrow.

#. **Building Arrow**

   This can be quite easy or a real blocker. Be prepared to dig through the
   additional flags for cmake in the C++ build guide and read the doc carefully
   to not miss any suggestions already given there. Anytime you are stuck,
   reach out to the team!
|
#. **Communication**

   Very important is communicating with the team. When you have an issue you
   want to solve it is advisable to let the team know you are working on it
   and may need some help.
|
#. **Finding your way through the project**

   You have an issue, you build Arrow and now you are completely lost. We get you.
   It is a complicated project and the first step is the hardest. We wrote some
   help guides that we used when we started. You will see that at the end it will
   all look much simpler as it did at the start.

If you are ready you can start with building Arrow or choose to follow tutorials
on writing an R or Python test.

**Have fun!**
