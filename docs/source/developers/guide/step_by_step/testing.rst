.. SCOPE OF THIS SECTION
.. This section should include extra description to the
.. language-specific documentation. Possible topics to
.. add: How to run one test, test file or all the tests
.. together and why is it good to do that.
.. What if the unconnected tests start failing? etc.

***********
Testing ðŸ§ª
***********

In Arrow we always add a unit test to the code we are
contributing. Therefore you will also need to add one when
you finish with your work.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Pytest

      We use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for
      unit tests in Python. For more info about the required
      packages follow
      :ref:`Python unit testing section <python-unit-testing>`.

      What we normally do is run the test we are working on
      only. Once we are finished with our work and then 
      we run other tests also.

      To run a specific unit test use this command in 
      the terminal from the ``arrow/python`` folder:

      .. code-block::

         python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py -k test_your_unit_test

      Run all the tests from one file:

      .. code-block::

         python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py

      Run all the tests:

      .. code-block::

         python -m pytest pyarrow

      If the tests start failing try to recompile
      PyArrow or C++.
      
      .. note::

         **Recompiling Cython**

         If you change only the .py file you do not need to
         recompile PyArrow. But you have to that if you make
         changes in .pyx or .pxd files.
        
         To do that run this command again:

         .. code-block::

            python setup.py build_ext --inplace

      .. note::
		
         **Recompiling C++**

         Similarly you will need to recompile C++ if you have
         done some changes in C++ files. In this case
         re-run the cmake commands again.
