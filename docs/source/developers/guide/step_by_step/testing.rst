In this section we outline steps needed for unit testing in Arrow.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Pytest

      We use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ for
      unit tests in Python. For more info about the required
      packages follow
      :ref:`Python unit testing section <python-unit-testing>`.

      To run a specific unit test, use this command in
      the terminal from the ``arrow/python`` folder:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py -k test_your_unit_test

      Run all the tests from one file:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow/tests/test_file.py

      Run all the tests:

      .. code:: console

         $ python -m pytest pyarrow

      If the tests start failing, try to recompile
      PyArrow or C++.

      .. note::

         **Recompiling Cython**

         If you only make changes to `.py` files, you do not need to
         recompile PyArrow. However, you should recompile it if you make
         changes in `.pyx` or `.pxd` files.

         To do that run this command again:

         .. code:: console

            $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

      .. note::

         **Recompiling C++**

         Similarly, you will need to recompile the C++ code if you have
         made changes to any C++ files. In this case,
         re-run the cmake commands again.

   .. tab:: R tests

      .. TODO
      We use `testthat <https://testthat.r-lib.org/index.html>` for unit
      testing in R. More specifically, we use the `3rd edition of testthat
      <https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/third-edition.html>`. On rare
      occasions we might want the behaviour of the 2nd edition of testthat,
      which is indicated by `testthat::local_edition(2)`.

      Expect the usual testthat folder structure:
      tests
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testthat      # unit test files live here
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testthat.R    # runs tests when R CMD check runs (e.g. with `devtools::check()`)

      Usually, most files in the `R/` sub-folder have a corresponding test
      file in `tests/testthat`.

      To run all tests in a package use `devtools::test()` in the R console.
      Alternatively, you can use `make test` in the shell.

      You can run the tests in a single test file you have open by calling
      `devtools::test_active_file()`.

      In general any change to source code needs to be accompanied by unit tests.
        * Add functionality -> add unit tests
        * Modify functionality -> update unit tests
        * Solve a bug -> add unit test before solving it, which helps prove
        bug and its fix
        * Performance improvements should be reflected in benchmarks
        (which are also tests)
        * An exception could be refactoring functionality that is fully covered
        by unit tests

      To complement the `testthat` functionality, arrow has defined a series
      of specific utility functions, such as:
        * Expectations - these start with `expect_` and are used to compare objects
            - For example, `expect_altrep_roundtrip()` compares the result
            of a function `fn` run on a vector `x` with the result of the
            same function run on the altrep version of `x`. More generally,
            expect_‚Ä¶_roundtrip() functions do ‚Ä¶  TODO _fill int the blanks_
            - Expect TODO
        * `skip_` - skips a unit test - think of them as acceptable fails.
        Situations in which we might want to skip unit tests:
            - `skip_if_r_version()` - this is a specific {arrow} skip. For
            example, we use this to skip a unit test when the R version is
            3.5.0 and below (skip_if_r_version(‚Äú3.5.0‚Äù)). You will likely
            see it used when the functionality we are testing depends on
            features introduced after version 3.5.0 of R (such as the
            alternative representation of vectors, Altrep, introduced in
            R 3.5.0, but with significant additions in subsequent releases)
            - `skip_if_not_available()` - another specific {arrow} skip.
            Arrow (libarrow) has a series of additional features that can
            be switched on or off (but this needs to happen at build time).
            If a unit test depends on such a feature and this feature is not
            available (i.e. was not selected when libarrow was built) the
            test is skipped, as opposed to having a failed test.
            - `skip_if_offline()` - will not run tests that require an
            internet connection
            - `skip_on_os()` - for unit tests that are OS specific.

      *Important*: Once the conditions for a `skip_()` statement is met,
      no other line of code in the same `test_that()` test block will
      get executed.
