.. SCOPE OF THIS SECTION
.. The aim of this section is to provide extra description to
.. the process of building Arrow library. It could include:
.. what does building mean, what is CMake, what are flags and why
.. do we use them, is building Arrow supposed to be straightforward?
.. etc.

.. Be sure not to duplicate with existing documentation!
.. All language-specific instructions about building, testing,
.. installing dependencies, etc. should go into language-specific
.. documentation.

*********************************
Building Arrow's libraries üèãüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
*********************************

If you decide to contribute to Arrow you will meet the topic of
compiling source code and use of CMake. You may have some
experience with it or not. If not, it is good to read through
this part so you understand what is happening in the process of
building Arrow better.

If you feel comfortable with compiling then feel free to proceed
to the :ref:`C++ <building-arrow-cpp>`, :ref:`PyArrow <build_pyarrow>` or
`R package build section <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/developing.html>`_.

Building C++
============

Why build C++ from source?
--------------------------

The core of Arrow is written in C++ and all bindings in other
languages (Python, R, ..) are wrapping underlying
C++ functions. Even if you want to work on PyArrow or R package
the source code of C++ may have to be edited also.

About CMake
-----------

CMake is a cross platform build system generator and it uses make
for the actual build. In the compiling process of Arrow what will
most probably be needed is some tweaking of the flags that are added
to cmake in the compiling process of Arrow.


Optional flags and why might we use them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TODO short description of the use of flags

.. seealso::
	Full list of optional flags: :ref:`cpp_build_optional_components`

.. Environment variables useful for developers
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TODO short description of the use of env vars

Building from source vs. using binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using binaries is a fast and simple way of working with the latest
Arrow version. But you do not have the possibility to add or change
the code and as a contributor you will need to.

Detailed instructions on building C++ library from source can
be found :ref:`here <building-arrow-cpp>`.

.. _build-pyarrow:

Building PyArrow
================

After building C++ part of Arrow you have to build PyArrow on top of it
also. The reason is the same, so you can edit the code and run tests on
the edited code you have locally.

**Why do we have to do builds separately?**

So Arrow C++ libraries are not bundled with the Python extension. This
is recommended for development as it allows the C++ libraries to be re-built
separately.

We hope this introduction was enough to help you start with the building
process.

	Follow the instructions to build PyArrow together with the C++ library
