Extending pyarrow
=================

Controlling conversion to pyarrow.Array with the ``__arrow_array__`` protocol
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :func:`pyarrow.array` function has built-in support for Python sequences,
numpy arrays and pandas 1D objects (Series, Index, Categorical, ..) to convert
those to Arrow arrays. This can be extended for other array-like objects
by implementing the ``__arrow_array__`` method (similar to numpy's ``__array__``
protocol).

For example, to support conversion of your duck array class to an Arrow array,
define the ``__arrow_array__`` method to return an Arrow array::

    class MyDuckArray:

        ...

        def __arrow_array__(self, type=None):
            # convert the underlying array values to a pyarrow Array
            import pyarrow
            return pyarrow.array(..., type=type)

The ``__arrow_array__`` method takes an optional `type` keyword which is passed
through from :func:`pyarrow.array`.


Defining extension types ("user-defined types")
-----------------------------------------------

Arrow has the notion of extension types in the metadata specification as a
possiblity to extend the built-in types. This is done by annotating any of the
built-in Arrow logical types (the "storage type") with a custom type name and
optional serialized representation ("ARROW:extension:name" and
"ARROW:extension:metadata" keys in the Fieldâ€™s custom_metadata of an IPC
message).
See the :ref:`format_metadata_extension_types` section of the metadata
specification for more details.

Pyarrow allows you to define such extension types from Python.

There are currently two ways:

* Subclassing :class:`PyExtensionType`: the (de)serialization is based on pickle.
  This is a good option for an extension type that is only used from Python.
* Subclassing :class:`ExtensionType`: this allows to give a custom
  Python-independent name and serialized metadata, that can potentially be
  recognized by other (non-Python) Arrow implementations such as PySpark.

For example, we could define a custom UUID type for 128-bit numbers which can
be represented as ``FixedSizeBinary`` type with 16 bytes.
Using the first approach, we create a ``UuidType`` subclass, and implement the
``__reduce__`` method to ensure the class can be properly pickled::

    class UuidType(pa.PyExtensionType):

        def __init__(self):
            pa.PyExtensionType.__init__(self, pa.binary(16))

        def __reduce__(self):
            return UuidType, ()

This can now be used to create arrays and tables holding the extension type::

    >>> uuid_type = UuidType()
    >>> uuid_type.extension_name
    'arrow.py_extension_type'
    >>> uuid_type.storage_type
    FixedSizeBinaryType(fixed_size_binary[16])

    >>> import uuid
    >>> storage_array = pa.array([uuid.uuid4().bytes for _ in range(4)], pa.binary(16))
    >>> arr = pa.ExtensionArray.from_storage(uuid_type, storage_array)
    >>> arr
    <pyarrow.lib.ExtensionArray object at 0x7f75c2f300a0>
    [
      A6861959108644B797664AEEE686B682,
      718747F48E5F4058A7261E2B6B228BE8,
      7FE201227D624D96A5CD8639DEF2A68B,
      C6CA8C7F95744BFD9462A40B3F57A86C
    ]

This array can be included in RecordBatches, sent over IPC and received in
another Python process. The custom UUID type will be preserved there, as long
as the definition of the class is available (the type can be unpickled).

We can define the same type using the other option::

    class UuidType(pa.ExtensionType):

        def __init__(self):
            pa.ExtensionType.__init__(self, pa.binary(16), "my_package.uuid")

        def __arrow_ext_serialize__(self):
            # since we don't have a parametrized type, we don't need extra
            # metadata to be deserialized
            return b''

        @classmethod
        def __arrow_ext_deserialize__(self, storage_type, serialized):
            return UuidType()

This is a slightly longer implementation (you need to implement the special
methods ``__arrow_ext_serialize__`` and ``__arrow_ext_deserialize__``), and the
extension type needs to be registered to be received through IPC, but it has
now a unique name::

    >>> uuid_type = UuidType()
    >>> uuid_type.extension_name
    'my_package.uuid'

    >>> pa.lib.register_extension_type(uuid_type)

The receiving application doesn't need to be Python but can still recognize
the extension type as a "uuid" type, if it has implemented its own extension
type to receive it.
