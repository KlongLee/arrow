ValueVector
===========

:class:`ValueVector` (which called Array in C++ implementation) is an abstraction
that is used to store a sequence of values having the same type in an individual
column. Internally, those values are represented by one or several buffers, the
number and meaning of which depend on the vectorâ€™s data type.

There are concrete subclasses of :class:`ValueVector` for each data type, that help
you access individual values of the array.

It is important that vector is allocated before attempting to read or write,
:class:`ValueVector` "should" strive to guarantee this order of operation:
allocate > mutate > setvaluecount > access > clear (or allocate to start the process over)

Building ValueVector
====================

Note that the current implementation doesn't enforce the rule that Arrow objects are immutable.
:class:`ValueVector` instances could be created directly by using new keyword, there are
set/setSafe APIs and concrete subclasses of FieldWriter for populating values.

For example, the code below shows how to build a :class:`BigIntVector`, in this case, we build a
vector of the range 1 to 8 where the element that should hold the value 4 is nulled::

   BufferAllocator allocator = new RootAllocator(Long.MAX_VALUE);

   BigIntVector vector = new BigIntVector("vector", allocator);
   vector.allocateNew(8);
   vector.set(0, 1);
   vector.set(1, 2);
   vector.set(2, 3);
   vector.setNull(3);
   vector.set(4, 5);
   vector.set(5, 6);
   vector.set(6, 7);
   vector.set(7, 8);
   vector.setValueCount(8);

The :class:`BigIntVector` holds two ArrowBufs. The first buffer holds the null bitmap, which consists
here of a single byte with the bits 0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0. The second buffer contains all the above values.
As the fourth entry is null, the value at that position in the buffer is undefined. Note compared with
set API, setSafe API would check value capacity before setting values and reallocate buffers if necessary.

Here is how to build a vector using writer::

   BigIntVector vector = new BigIntVector("vector", allocator);
   BigIntWriter writer = new BigIntWriterImpl(vector);
   writer.setPosition(0);
   writer.writeBigInt(1);
   writer.setPosition(1);
   writer.writeBigInt(2);
   writer.setPosition(2);
   writer.writeBigInt(3);
   writer.setPosition(4);
   writer.writeBigInt(5);
   writer.setPosition(5);
   writer.writeBigInt(6);
   writer.setPosition(6);
   writer.writeBigInt(7);
   writer.setPosition(7);
   writer.writeBigInt(8);
There are get API and concrete subclasses of :class:`FieldReader` for accessing vector values, what needs
to be declared is that writer/reader is not as efficient as direct access::

    // access via get API
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.getValueCount(); i++) {
      if (!vector.isNull(i)) {
        System.out.println(vector.get(i));
      }
    }

    // access via reader
    BigIntReader reader = vector.getReader();
    for (int i = 0; i < vector.getValueCount(); i++) {
      reader.setPosition(i);
      if (reader.isSet()) {
        System.out.println(reader.readLong());
      }
    }


Slicing
====================
Similar with C++ implementation, it is possible to make zero-copy slices of vectors to obtain a vector
referring to some logical subsequence of the data through :class:`TransferPair`::

    IntVector vector = new IntVector("intVector", allocator);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      vector.setSafe(i, i);
    }
    vector.setValueCount(10);

    TransferPair tp = vector.getTransferPair(allocator);
    tp.splitAndTransfer(0, 5);
    IntVector sliced = (IntVector) tp.getTo();
