The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.3.0 release of the
project. It is the product of an intense 10 weeks of development since the
0.2.0 release from this past February. It includes [**263 resolved JIRAs**][1]
from [**23 contributors**][14].

While we have added many new features to the different Arrow implementations,
one of the major development focuses in 2017 has been hardening the in-memory
format and type metadata to provide a **stable, production-ready foundation**
for big data applications that want to integrate the Arrow libraries. We are
excited to be collaborating with the [Apache Spark][3] and [GeoMesa][2]
communities on utilizing Arrow for high performance IO and in-memory data
processing.

See the [Install Page][6] to learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

### File and Streaming Format Hardening

The 0.2.0 release brought with it the first iterations of the **random access**
and **streaming** Arrow wire formats. See the [IPC specification][15] for
implementation details and [example blog post][4] with some use cases. These
provide low-overhead, zero-copy access to Arrow record batch payloads.

In 0.3.0 we have solidified a number of small details with the binary format
and improved our integration and unit testing in the Java, C++, and Python
libraries. Using the [Google Flatbuffers][5] project has helped with adding new
features to our metadata without breaking forward compatibility.

We are not yet ready to make a firm commitment to strong forward compatibility
(in case we find something needs to change) in the binary format, but we will
make efforts between major releases to not make unnecessary breakages.

### Dictionary Encoding Support

[Emilio Lahr-Vivaz][13] from the [GeoMesa][2] project contributed Java support
for dictionary-encoded Arrow vectors. We followed up with C++ and Python
support (and `pandas.Categorical` integration). We have not yet implemented
full integration tests for dictionaries (for sending this data between C++ and
Java), but hope to achieve this in the 0.4.0 Arrow release.

This common data representation technique for categorical data allows multiple
record batches to share a common "dictionary", with the values in the batches
being represented as integers referencing the dictionary. This data is called
"categorical" or "factor" in statistical languages, while in file formats like
Apache Parquet it is strictly used for data compression.

### Expanded Date, Time, and Fixed Size Types

A notable omission from the 0.2.0 release was complete and integration-tested
support for the gamut of date and time types that occur in the wild.

* Date: 32-bit (days unit) and 64-bit (milliseconds unit)
* Time: 64-bit integer with unit (second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond)
* Timestamp: 64-bit integer with unit, with or without timezone
* Fixed Size Binary: Primitive values occupying certain number of bytes
* Fixed Size List: List values with constant size (no separate offsets vector)

We have additionally added support for exact decimals in C++ using
[Boost.Multiprecision][12], though we have not yet hardened the Decimal memory
format between the Java and C++ implementations.

### C++ and Python Support on Windows

We have made many general improvements to development and packaging for general
C++ and Python development. 0.3.0 is the first release to bring full C++ and
Python support for Windows on Visual Studio (MSVC) 2015 and 2017. In addition
to adding Appveyor continuous integration for MSVC, we have also written guides
for building from source on Windows: [C++][7] and [Python][8].

### C (GLib) Bindings, with support for Ruby, Lua, and more

[Kouhei Sutou][9] is a new Apache Arrow committer and has contributed GLib C
bindings (to the C++ libraries) for Linux. Using a C middleware framework
called [GObject Introspection][10], it is possible to use these bindings
seamlessly in Ruby, Lua, Go, and [other programming languages][11]. We will
probably need to publish some follow up blogs explaining how these bindings
work and how to use them.
