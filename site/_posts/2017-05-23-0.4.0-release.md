The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.4.0 release of the
project. While only 17 days since the release, it includes [**77 resolved
JIRAs**][1] with some important new features and bug fixes.

### Generalizing Arrow Streams

In the 0.2.0 release, we defined the first version of the Arrow streaming
binary format for low-cost messaging with columnar data. These streams presume
that the message components are written as a continuous byte stream over a
socket or file.

We would like to be able to support other other transport protocols, like
[gRPC][3], for the message components of Arrow streams. To that end, in C++ we
defined an abstract stream reader interface, for which the current contiguous
streaming format is one implementation:

{% highlight cpp %}
class RecordBatchReader {
 public:
  virtual std::shared_ptr<Schema> schema() const = 0;
  virtual Status GetNextRecordBatch(std::shared_ptr<RecordBatch>* batch) = 0;
};
{% endhighlight %}

In an upcoming blog post, we will explain in more depth how Arrow streams work,
but you can learn more about them by reading the [IPC specification][4].
