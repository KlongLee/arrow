The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 0.6.0 release. It includes
[**90 resolved JIRAs**][1] with the new Plasma shared memory object store, and
improvements and bug fixes to the various language implementations. The Arrow
memory format remains stable since the 0.3.x release.

See the [Install Page][2] to learn how to get the libraries for your
platform. The [complete changelog][5] is also available.

## Plasma Object Store



## Arrow Format Additions

## Python Changes

Some highlights of Python development outside of bug fixes and general API
improvements include:

* New `strings_to_categorical=True` option when calling `Table.to_pandas` will
  yield pandas `Categorical` types from Arrow binary and string columns
* Expanded Hadoop Filesystem (HDFS) functionality to improve compatibility with
  Dask and other HDFS-aware Python libraries.
* s3fs and other Dask-oriented filesystems can now be used with
  `pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset`
* More graceful handling of pandas's nanosecond timestamps when writing to
  Parquet format. You can now pass `coerce_timestamps='ms'` to cast to
  milliseconds, or `'us'` for microseconds.

## Toward Arrow 1.0.0 and Beyond

We have much work ahead of us to build out Arrow integrations in other data
systems to improve their processing performance and interoperability with other
systems.

We are still discussing the roadmap to 1.0.0 release on the [developer mailing
list][6]. The focus of the 1.0.0 release will likely be memory format stability
and hardening integration tests across the remaining data types implemented in
Java and C++. Please join the discussion there.
