### Project and Product names using "Apache Arrow"

Organizations creating products and projects for use with Apache Arrow, along
with associated marketing materials, should take care to respect the trademark
in "Apache Arrow" and its logo. Please refer to [ASF Trademarks Guidance][1]
and associated [FAQ][2] for comprehensive and authoritative guidance on proper
usage of ASF trademarks.

Names that do not include "Apache Arrow" at all have no potential trademark
issue with the Apache Arrow project. This is recommended.

Names like "Apache Arrow BigCoProduct" are not OK, as are names including
"Apache Arrow" in general. The above links, however, describe some exceptions,
like for names such as "BigCoProduct, powered by Apache Arrow" or
"BigCoProduct for Apache Arrow".

It is common practice to create software identifiers (Maven coordinates, module
names, etc.) like "arrow-foo". These are permitted. Nominative use of trademarks
in descriptions is also always allowed, as in "BigCoProduct is a widget for
Apache Arrow".
