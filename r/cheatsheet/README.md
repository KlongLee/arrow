# Arrow R Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet was drawn with [Inkscape](inkscape.org) 1.1 and also the Apache Arrow logo.
Don't use older inkscape versions to edit the contents and if you edit the SVG files remember
to have Roboto Condensed, Mono and Slab installed beforehand.

The final cheatsheet is obtaining by exporting each SVG to a PDF and then running
```
pdftk arrow-cheat-sheet-front-page.pdf arrow-cheat-sheet-back-page.pdf output arrow-cheat-sheet.pdf
```
