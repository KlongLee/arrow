# Style

This is a style guide for writing documentation for [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/).

* Please use the [tidyverse coding style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

* When referring to packages, include a link to the package at the first mention, and subsequently refer to it in plain text (e.g. "The arrow package implements multiple [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) verbs and allows similar syntax to dplyr.")

* When referring the concept, write use the phrase "data frame", whereas when referring to an object of that class, or when the class is important, write `data.frame`  (e.g. "Similar concepts to the `head` method for a `data.frame` object can be found in other data frame implementations.").
