# Style

This is a style guide for writing documentation for [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/).

* Please use the [tidyverse coding style](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

* When referring to packages, link to the package at the first mention, and subsequently refer to it in plain text (without backticks).

* When referring the concept, write use the phrase "data frame", whereas when referring to an object of that class, or when the class is important, write `data.frame`  (e.g. "the `head` method for a `data.frame` object...").
