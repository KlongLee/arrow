Development versions of the package (binary and source) are built
nightly and hosted at <https://nightlies.apache.org/arrow/r/>. To
install from there:

``` r
install.packages("arrow", repos = c(arrow = "https://nightlies.apache.org/arrow/r", getOption("repos")))
```

Conda users can install `arrow` nightly builds with

``` shell
conda install -c arrow-nightlies -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority r-arrow
```

If you already have a version of `arrow` installed, you can switch to
the latest nightly development version with

``` r
arrow::install_arrow(nightly = TRUE)
```

These nightly package builds are not official Apache releases and are
not recommended for production use. They may be useful for testing bug
fixes and new features under active development.
