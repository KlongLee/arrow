On macOS and Windows, when you `install.packages("arrow")`,
you get a binary package that contains Arrowâ€™s C++ dependencies along with it.
On Linux, `install.packages()` retrieves a source package that has to be compiled locally,
and C++ dependencies need to be resolved as well.
Generally for R packages with C++ dependencies,
this requires either installing system packages, which you may not have privileges to do,
or building the C++ dependencies separately,
which introduces all sorts of additional ways for things to go wrong.

Our goal is to make `install.packages("arrow")` "just work" for as many Linux distributions,
versions, and configurations as possible.
This document describes how it works and the options for fine-tuning Linux installation.
The intended audience for this document is `arrow` R package users on Linux, not developers.
If you're contributing to the Arrow project,
you'll probably want to manage your C++ installation more directly.
Note also that if you use `conda` to manage your R environment, this document does not apply.
You can `conda install -c conda-forge r-arrow` and you'll get the latest official
release of the R package along with any C++ dependencies.

# Installation basics

Install the latest release of `arrow` from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("arrow")
```

Daily development builds, which are not official releases,
can be installed from the Ursa Labs repository:

```r
install.packages("arrow", repos = "https://dl.bintray.com/ursalabs/arrow-r")
```

There currently are no daily `conda` builds.

You can also install the R package from a git checkout:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow
cd arrow/r
R CMD INSTALL .
```

# How dependencies are resolved

When you install the `arrow` R package on Linux,
it will first attempt to find the Arrow C++ libraries on your system using `pkg-config`.
This will find either installed system packages or libraries you've built yourself.
If you've built the C++ libraries from source
but haven't installed them where `pkg-config` will find them,
you can instead set `INCLUDE_DIR` and `LIB_DIR` environment variables to point to their location.

If no Arrow C++ libraries are found on the system,
it will next attempt to download prebuilt static Arrow C++ libraries, hosted by Ursa Labs,
that match your both your local operating system and `arrow` R package version.
If found, they will be downloaded and bundled when your R package compiles.
<!-- TODO: link to bintray to show current list of supported OSes? -->

If no binary is found, it will download the Arrow C++ source that matches the R package version
(CRAN release or nightly build) and attempt to build it locally.
If no matching source bundle is found, it will also look to see if you are in
a checkout of the `apache/arrow` git repository and thus have the C++ source there.
Depending on your system, building Arrow C++ from source likely will be slow;
consequently, it is designed to happen only when you
run `install.packages("arrow")` or `R CMD INSTALL` but not when running `R CMD check`,
unless you've set the `NOT_CRAN=true` environment variable.

For the mechanics of how all this works, see the R package `configure` script,
which calls `tools/linuxlibs.R`.
If the C++ library is built from source, `inst/build_arrow_static.sh` is executed.
This build script is also what is used to generate the prebuilt binaries.

# Troubleshooting and additional options

## Using system libraries

If a system library or other installed Arrow is found but it doesn't match the R package version,
it is likely that the R bindings will fail to compile.
Because the Apache Arrow project is under active development,
is it essential that versions of the C++ and R libraries match.
When `install.packages("arrow")` has to download the C++ libraries,
the install script ensures that you fetch the C++ libraries that correspond to your R package version.
However, if you are using Arrow libraries already on your system, version match isn't guaranteed.

To fix version mismatch, you can either update your system packages to match the R package version,
or set the environment variable `ARROW_USE_PKGCONFIG=FALSE`
to tell the configure script not to look for system Arrow packages.
System packages are available corresponding to all CRAN releases
but not for nightly or dev versions, so depending on the R package version you're installing,
system packages may not be an option.

Note also that once you have a working R package installation based on system (shared) libraries,
if you update your system Arrow, you'll need to reinstall the R package to match its version.

## Using prebuilt binaries

If a prebuilt binary is downloaded but then the `arrow` package can't be loaded,
perhaps with "undefined symbols" errors,
please [report an issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues).
This is likely a compiler mismatch and may be resolvable by setting some
environment variables to instruct R to compile the packages to match the C++ library.
A workaround would be to set the environment variable `LIBARROW_BINARY_DISTRO=FALSE`
and retry installation: this value instructs the package to build the C++ library from source
instead of downloading the prebuilt binary.

If a prebuilt binary wasn't found but you think it should have been,
check the logs for a message that says `*** Unable to identify current OS/version`,
or a message that says `*** No C++ binaries found for` an invalid OS.
If you see either, please [report an issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues).
You may also set the environment variable `ARROW_R_DEV=TRUE` for additional
debug messages.

A workaround would be to set the environment variable `LIBARROW_BINARY_DISTRO`
to a `distribution-version` that exists in the Ursa Labs repository.
<!-- give example, once one exists -->
Setting `LIBARROW_BINARY_DISTRO` is also an option when there's not an exact match
for your OS but a similar version would work,
such as if you're on Ubuntu 18.10 and there's only a binary for 18.04.

<!-- If no binary found for current nightly R package version but yes for yesterday? -->
<!-- TODO add a function to the package to update dev version from bintray? -->
<!-- If that exists, is there a flag to instruct building without arrow so you can access that fn? (yes: LIBARROW_BUILD=FALSE)-->

## Building C++ from source

If building the C++ library from source fails, check the error message.
The install script attempts to install any necessary build dependencies,
such as `cmake`, but it's possible that some operating systems may require additional ones.
You may be able to install them and retry.
Regardless, if the C++ library fails to compile,
please [report an issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues)
so that we can attempt to improve the script.

## Summary of build environment variables

By default, these are all unset.

* `ARROW_USE_PKGCONFIG`: If set to `FALSE`, the configure script
  won't look for Arrow libraries on your system and instead will look to download/build them.
  Use this if you have a version mismatch between installed system libraries
  and the version of the R package you're installing.
* `LIBARROW_DOWNLOAD`: If set to `FALSE` (case insensitive), the build script
  will not attempt to download C++ binary or source bundles.
  Use this if you're in a checkout of the `apache/arrow` git repository
  and want to build the C++ library from the local source.
* `LIBARROW_BUILD`: If set to `FALSE` (case insensitive), the build script
  will not attempt to build the C++ from source. This means you will only get
  a working `arrow` R package if a prebuilt binary is found.
  Use this if you want to avoid compiling the C++ library, which may be slow
  and resource-intensive, and ensure that you only use a prebuilt binary.
* `LIBARROW_BINARY_DISTRO`: If set to `FALSE` (case insensitive),
  the script will not download a binary, but it may still download a source bundle.
  You may also set it to some other string,
  a related "distro-version" that has binaries built that work for your OS.
* `NOT_CRAN`: If this variable is set to `true`, as the `devtools` package does,
  the build script will attempt to download and/or build the Arrow C++ library, if necessary,
  even when running `R CMD check`. Otherwise, it will only download/build C++
  if you're not running `R CMD check`.
  The purpose of this protection is to avoid expensive compilation in
  automated testing environments (unless you opt-in).
* `ARROW_R_DEV`: If set to `TRUE`, more verbose messaging will be printed
  in the build script. This variable also is needed if you're modifying `Rcpp`
  code in the package: see "Editing Rcpp code" in the README.
* `DEBUG_DIR`: If the C++ library building from source fails (`cmake`),
  there may be messages telling you to check some log file in the build directory.
  However, when the library is built during R package installation,
  that location is in a temp directory that is already deleted.
  To capture those logs, set this variable to an absolute (not relative) path
  and the log files will be copied there.
  The directory will be created if it does not exist.
