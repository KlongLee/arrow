# Using docker with Arrow

Arrow is compatible with a huge number of combinations of OSs, OS versions, 
compilers, R versions, and other variables.  Sometimes these combinations of 
variables means that behaviours are found in some environments which cannot be 
replicated in others.  In addition, there are different ways of building Arrow, 
for example, using environment variables to specify the building of optional 
components.

What all this means is that you may need to use a different setup to the one in 
which you are working, when diagnosing a bug or testing out a new feature which 
you have reason to believe may be affected by these variables.  One way to do 
this is so spin up a Docker image containing the desired setup.

This article provides a basic guide to using Docker in your R development.

## How do I run a Docker container?

There are a number of images which have been created for the convenience of 
Arrow devs and you can find them on [the DockerHub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/arrow-dev/tags).

The code below shows an example command you could use to run a Docker container.

```shell
docker run -it -e ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=AUTO -v $(pwd):/arrow apache/arrow-dev:r-rhub-ubuntu-gcc-release-latest
```

Components:

* `docker run` - command to run the container
* `-it` - run with an interactive terminal so you can run commands on the containers
* `-e ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE=AUTO` - set the environment variable `ARROW_DEPENDENCY_SOURCE` to the value `AUTO`
* `-v $(pwd):/arrow` - mount the current directory at `/arrow` in the container
* `apache/arrow-dev` - the DockerHub repo to get this container from
* `r-rhub-ubuntu-gcc-release-latest` - the image tag

Once you run this command, if you don't have a copy of that particular image 
saved locally, it will first be downloaded before a container is spun up.

In the example above, mounting the directory in which the Arrow repo was stored 
on the local machine, meant that that code could be built and tested on the 
container.

## How do I exit this image?

On Linux, press Ctrl+D.

## How do I show all images saved?

```shell
docker images
```

## How do I show all running containers?

```shell
docker ps
```

## How do I show all containers?

```shell
sudo docker ps -a
```

## Using Archery

Alternatively, you may prefer to use the [Archery tool to run docker images](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/docker.html).
This has the advantage of making it simpler to build some of the existing Arrow 
CI jobs which have hierarchical dependencies, and so for example, you could 
build the R package on a container which already has the C++ code pre-built.
