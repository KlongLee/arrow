# Debugging Arrow

If you are a developer working with Arrow code, the package's use of tidy eval 
and C++ necessitates a solid debugging strategy.  In this article, we reccommend
a few approaches.

## Debugging R code

The following resources provide detailed guides to debugging R code:
* [Advanaced R's chapter on debugging](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html)
* [The RStudio debugging documentation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/205612627-Debugging-with-RStudio)

In general, we have found that using interactive debugging (e.g. calls to 
`browser()`), where you can inspect objects in a particular environment, is 
more efficient than simpler techniques such as `print()` statements.

## Getting more descriptive C++ error messages 

If you are working in the RStudio IDE, your R session will be aborted if there is
a segfault.  If you re-run your code in a command-line R session, the session 
isn't automatically aborted and so it will be possible to copy the error 
message accompanying the segfault.

```shell
R
> cpp11::cpp_function("double this_will_crash() { double* some_array = nullptr; return some_array[INT_MAX]; }"); this_will_crash()
#  *** caught segfault ***
# address 0x3fffffff8, cause 'memory not mapped'
# 
# Traceback:
#  1: .Call("_code_12cc653bfe09b_this_will_crash", PACKAGE = "code_12cc653bfe09b")
#  2: this_will_crash()
```

### Running R code with the C++ debugger

As Arrow has C++ code at its core, debugging code can sometimes be tricky when 
errors originate in the C++ rather than the R layer.  If you are adding new code
which triggers a C++ bug (or find one in existing code), this can result in a 
segfault.  If you are working in RStudio, the session is aborted, and you may 
not be able to retrieve the error messaging needed to diagnose and/or report 
the bug.  One way around this is to find the code that causes the error, and 
run R with a C++ debugger.

Firstly, load R with your debugger.  The most common debuggers are `gdb` and `lldb`

In my case it's `gdb`, but if you're using the `lldb` debugger (for example, 
if you're on a Mac), just swap in 
that command here.

```shell
R -d gdb
```

Next, run R.

```shell
run
```

You should now be in an R session with the C++ debugger attached.  This will 
look similar to a normal R session, but with extra output.

Now, run your code - either directly in the session or by sourcing it from a 
file.  If the code results in a segfault, you will have extra output that you 
can use to diagnose the problem or attach to an issue as extra information.

Here is an example of some R code that intentionally causes a segfault, as well 
as the output produced.

```
